An assertion is the primary form of testing available in assertivedocs, and they take the form of
`<list,of,arguments>=><expected_output>`.

In [Tutorial 2.1](/tutorial-firstassertion.html), you will learn how to create a basic assertion in 
your documentation.

[Tutorial 2.2](/tutorial-typeoperators.html) covers how to specify the type of your arguments and 
the expected output.

Finally, [Tutorial 2.3](/tutorial-nullnanundefined.html) teaches you how to use the `undefined`, 
`null`, and `NaN` values in your arguments and expected outputs.
